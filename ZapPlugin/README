Scenario:

Angular transports POST requests with a content-type of application/json
(for reference, POST is usually form/url-encoded)

Some server-side languages have issues with that --notably PHP


Instructions:
cd to this folder
php -S localhost:8081
open firefox
browse to localhost:8081
insert <img src=x onerror=alert(1)//"> as a username and any password
press Login
enjoy the popup


Open Zap
Configure Zap to run on port 8090
Proxy firefox through zap
Set zap to intercept all requests
